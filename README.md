# Hand-Tracking-Using-Python-with-Interactive-applications
Hand Tracking using python libraries OpenCV and Mediapipe and displaying it in real time along with 3 interactive applications (Drawing Panel, Whack a mole game, Piano).

Libraries Used
- OpenCV: For capturing webcam input and rendering visuals.
- MediaPipe: For hand gesture detection and tracking.
- NumPy: For efficient numerical operations on images.
- Pygame: For sound integration and game interactions.

Features
- Hand tracking wiht real-time visual feedback to interact with applications on screen 
- Drawing Mode:
  - Real-time drawing with various colors.
  - Eraser tool for modifications.
- Game Mode:
  - "Whack-a-Mole" controlled via hand gestures.
  - Score tracking and dynamic mole placement.
- Piano Mode:
  - Virtual piano keys triggered by finger movement.
  - Plays musical notes in real-time.

Steps to perform
1. Setup:
   - Install required libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, Pygame, NumPy.
   - Ensure webcam and microphone are functional.
   - **Replace paths to sound and Image files in code to your own paths.**
2. Run Application:
   - Execute the Python script.
   - Select a mode: Drawing, Game, or Piano.
3. Explore:
   - Test each feature using hand gestures.
   - Observe real-time feedback on the screen.

Future Enhancements:
Multi-hand interaction.
Customizable modes and features.
Enhanced graphical interface.
Creating an overlay on the screen to access other applications with hand gestures.
